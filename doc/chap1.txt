  [33X[0;0YThe  [13Xclass number[113X [23Xk(G)[123X of a group [23XG[123X is the number of conjugacy classes of [23XG[123X.
  In 1903, Landau proved in [Lan03] that for every [23Xn \in \mathbb{N}[123X, there are
  only  finitely  many  finite  groups  with  exactly [23Xn[123X conjugacy classes. The
  [12XSmallClassNr[112X  package provides access to the finite groups with class number
  at most [23X14[123X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThese groups were classified in the following papers:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[23Xk(G)  \leq  5[123X,  by  Miller in [Mil11] and independently by Burnside in
        [Bur11][133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[23Xk(G) = 6,7[123X, by Poland in [Pol68][133X

  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[23Xk(G) = 9[123X, by Odincov and Starostin in [OS76][133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[23Xk(G) = 10,11[123X, by Vera LÃ³pez and Vera LÃ³pez in [VLVL85] (1)[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[23Xk(G) = 12[123X, by Vera LÃ³pez and Vera LÃ³pez in [VLVL86] (2)[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[23Xk(G) = 13, 14[123X, by Vera LÃ³pez and Sangroniz in [VLS07][133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y(1)  In [VLVL85], three distinct groups of the form [23X(C_5 \times C_5) \rtimes
  C_4[123X  order [23X100[123X with class number [23X10[123X are given. However, only two such groups
  exist, being the ones with [10XIdClassNr[110X equal to [10X[10,25][110X and [10X[10,26][110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y(2)  In  [VLVL86], only 48 groups with class number 12 are listed. The three
  missing groups are provided in the appendix of [VLS07]. These are the groups
  with [10XIdClassNr[110X equal to [10X[12,13][110X, [10X[12,16][110X and [10X[12,39][110X.[133X
